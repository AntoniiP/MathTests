A NodeJS implementation of the [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) equations.
The Lorenz system is a set of three coupled differential equations used to model the behavior of a simplified atmosphere.
It generates a 2D plot of the system with two different but closely set initial conditions, showcasing the chaotic behavior of the system.
